1.  What is Computer Vision
  1.  Example Problems
    * stitching together Google maps & street view
    * safety (driving between highway lines)
    * robotics
    * mass-produced goods inspected via CV
    * automatically labeling images
    * motion tracking [people, cars, MS Kinect]
  xx.  Major methods/techniques [seems to be under 4 now]
  3.  state-of-the-art
    * ImageNet (dataset and learning architecture)
    * what preprocessing was necessary to make the dataset!
  4.  Friends:
    * comptuer graphics:  data -> displayed image
    * image proc/analysis:  2D image -> 2D image or statistics
    * computer vision: multiple 2D scenes -> 3D data
    * machine vision: above as part of automated system (QC, monitoring, robotics, etc.)

  5.  vision systems architecture: (wikipedia)
    * (physics of image formation:  how light gets to the camera/sensor)
    * image acquisition:  sensor(s) -> data
      * might want to talk briefly about additive/subtractive colors
    * pre-processing:  data sampling, noise/contrast/scale correction
    * feature extraction:  lines, edges, ridges, corners, blobs, points
                            (texture/motion related)
    * [MEF] prefer to separate segmentation & (object) recognition
    * detection/segmentation:  
      * define ROI, segment to regions, scene segmentation
      * (area with object of interest?)
    * "high level processing":
      * apply analysis
        * counting/attrs of objects of a type,
        * obj. size/pose, objs -> categories
      * object recognition & scene understanding
    * decision making
      * P/F match/not to control system
      * alert/flag to human
  4.  "image understanding" (wikipedia)
    * Low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions;
    * intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and
    * high level includes objects, scenes, or events.

2.  OpenCV
  1.  About
    * bsd license
    * bindings in several languages (c/c++/java/python/matlab)
    * supports several platforms (Win/Lin/Mac/Android/iOS)
    * written in C++ (templated/STL)
    * open source CV and ML library
    * claims 2500 algorithm implementations
      >  These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality

  2. Major components
    * core:  we largely rely on numpy for much of htis
    * imgproc:  great fundamental routines
    * highgui:  cross-platform rendering and image interaction (we don't really discuss - but you can easily spend 20 minutes playing with it)
    * specific 1st-party modules for tasks: objdetect, dnn & ml (learning), cuda*, video, etc.
    * contributed extra, non-free, and/or 3rd party modules:
  3.  relationship to NumPy
    * through the wizardry of opencv/modules/python/src2/cv2.cpp,
      we get numpy arrays that manipulate the image data of opencv images
    * this let's us replace much of opencv2.core with generic (and short!) numpy
      code.  (*compare a C++ example with a Python example*)

* consider pure python comments?

3.  NumPy
  1.  About
    * foundation of numerical computing (number crunching) in python
    * basis of scipy/ scikit-\* etc.
    * and!  used for memory storage of OpenCV
    * roots trace to mid-90s with "Numeric" and then numarray.
      * numpy 1.0:  2006.
      * recent stable:  29 september 2017; 1.13.3
  2.  we see:  ndarray
    * we see:  vectorized operations (a*b instead of looping)
    * under-the-hood:
      * fixed memory layout; fixed datatype
        * like a C-array on the heap
      * b/c it is raw memory, there isn't the HLL overhead of python
      * b/c memory is localized, takes advantage of (spatial) caching locality
      * can apply vectorized operations at the CPU level
  3.  we use:  operations
    * under the hood:
      * broad:  matching elements between arrays whose shapes are not identical
                (repeating - w/o copying - smaller dimension to larger)
      * ufunc:  fast element-wise array operation
         * lots of wrapping gets us to C code:
         * python bits generated by:
           * numpy/core/code_generators/generate_umath.py
         * C code:  numpy/core/src/umath/funcs.inc.src#L111
      * linking to fast C and Fortran code for matrix operations
        * e.g., dot -> BLAS/ATLAS/MKL code
